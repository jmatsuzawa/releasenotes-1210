= Installation =

== Overview ==

Preparing your computer for Lubuntu is now simpler, with a wider range of disk setup options. Each of these are detailed at length to provide you with a clear understanding of the actions that will take place with your selection.

You can now reinstall or upgrade an existing copy of Lubuntu with the Desktop CD installer, provided that your computer is connected to the Internet. 

== Download  ==

To download Lubuntu and see the various options available head over to [[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Lubuntu/GetLubuntu | Get Lubuntu]]. This section also discusses both the standard installs and those required for computers with low memory (RAM), old chipsets (i586), PowerPC, Mac and low disk-space (netbooks).

== System Requirements ==

A Pentium II or Celeron system with 128 MB of RAM is probably a bottom-line configuration that may yield slow yet usable system with a standard lubuntu desktop.

Default i686 (32 bit) images support more hardware than the equivalent Ubuntu image, as it uses a non-PAE kernel, but is limited to 4 GB of memory. If you have more than 4 GB of memory on a 32 bit system, head over to [[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Lubuntu/GetLubuntu | Get Lubuntu]] for a fuller discussion.

For PowerPC, it is known to run on a G4 running at 867MHz with 640MB RAM. 

For Intel based Macs, lubuntu should run on all models.

See [[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Lubuntu/GetLubuntu | Get Lubuntu]] for fuller details as to which download to use.
